    "text": "The Elves begin to set up camp on the beach. To decide whose tent gets to be closest to the snack storage, a giant Rock Paper Scissors tournament is already in progress.\nRock Paper Scissors is a game between two players. Each game contains many rounds; in each round, the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand shape. Then, a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper defeats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.\nAppreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an encrypted strategy guide (your puzzle input) that they say will be sure to help you win. “The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors. The second column–” Suddenly, the Elf is called away to help with someone’s tent.\nThe second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors. Winning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have been carefully chosen.\nThe winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your total score is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).\nSince you can’t be sure if the Elf is trying to help you or trick you, you should calculate the score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.\nFor example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:\nA Y B X C Z This strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:\nIn the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won). In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 + 0). The third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6. In this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).\nWhat would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n# first:  A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors\n# second:  X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors\nreadLines(\"day2.txt\") %&gt;% \n  tibble(input = .) %&gt;% \n  tidyr::separate(input, into = c(\"first\", \"second\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(winner = case_when(first == \"A\" & second == \"X\" ~ 3,\n                            first == \"A\" & second == \"Y\" ~ 6,\n                            first == \"A\" & second == \"Z\" ~ 0,\n                            first == \"B\" & second == \"X\" ~ 0,\n                            first == \"B\" & second == \"Y\" ~ 3,\n                            first == \"B\" & second == \"Z\" ~ 6,\n                            first == \"C\" & second == \"X\" ~ 6,\n                            first == \"C\" & second == \"Y\" ~ 0,\n                            first == \"C\" & second == \"Z\" ~ 3),\n         type = case_when(second == \"X\" ~ 1,\n                          second == \"Y\" ~ 2,\n                          second == \"Z\" ~ 3),\n         score = winner + type) %&gt;%\n  pull(score) %&gt;% \n  sum()\n\n[1] 12740\n\n\n\n\n\n— Part Two — The Elf finishes helping with the tent and sneaks back over to you. “Anyway, the second column says how the round needs to end: X means you need to lose, Y means you need to end the round in a draw, and Z means you need to win. Good luck!”\nThe total score is still calculated in the same way, but now you need to figure out what shape to choose so the round ends as indicated. The example above now goes like this:\nIn the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you need the round to end in a draw (Y), so you also choose Rock. This gives you a score of 1 + 3 = 4. In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you choose Rock so you lose (X) with a score of 1 + 0 = 1. In the third round, you will defeat your opponent’s Scissors with Rock for a score of 1 + 6 = 7.

Occasionally, you can even hear much louder sounds in the distance; how big do the animals get out here, anyway?\nThe device the Elves gave you has problems with more than just its communication system. You try to run a system update:\n$ system-update --please --pretty-please-with-sugar-on-top \nError: No space left on device\nPerhaps you can delete some files to make space for the update?\nYou browse around the filesystem to assess the situation and save the resulting terminal output (your puzzle input). For example:\n$ cd /\n$ ls\ndir a\n14848514 b.txt\n8504156 c.dat\ndir d\n$ cd a\n$ ls\ndir e\n29116 f\n2557 g\n62596 h.lst\n$ cd e\n$ ls\n584 i\n$ cd ..\n$ cd ..\n$ cd d\n$ ls\n4060174 j\n8033020 d.log\n5626152 d.ext\n7214296 k\nThe filesystem consists of a tree of files (plain data) and directories (which can contain other directories or files). The outermost directory is called /. You can navigate around the filesystem, moving into or out of directories and listing the contents of the directory you’re currently in.\nWithin the terminal output, lines that begin with $ are commands you executed, very much like some modern computers:\ncd means change directory. This changes which directory is the current directory, but the specific result depends on the argument: cd x moves in one level: it looks in the current directory for the directory named x and makes it the current directory. cd .. moves out one level: it finds the directory that contains the current directory, then makes that directory the current directory. cd / switches the current directory to the outermost directory, /. ls means list. It prints out all of the files and directories immediately contained by the current directory: 123 abc means that the current directory contains a file named abc with size 123. dir xyz means that the current directory contains a directory named xyz. Given the commands and output in the example above, you can determine that the filesystem looks visually like this:\n- / (dir)\n  - a (dir)\n    - e (dir)\n      - i (file, size=584)\n    - f (file, size=29116)\n    - g (file, size=2557)\n    - h.lst (file, size=62596)\n  - b.txt (file, size=14848514)\n  - c.dat (file, size=8504156)\n  - d (dir)\n    - j (file, size=4060174)\n    - d.log (file, size=8033020)\n    - d.ext (file, size=5626152)\n    - k (file, size=7214296)\nHere, there are four directories: / (the outermost directory), a and d (which are in /), and e (which is in a). These directories also contain files of various sizes.\nSince the disk is full, your first step should probably be to find directories that are good candidates for deletion. To do this, you need to determine the total size of each directory. The total size of a directory is the sum of the sizes of the files it contains, directly or indirectly. (Directories themselves do not count as having any intrinsic size.)\nThe total sizes of the directories above can be found as follows:\nThe total size of directory e is 584 because it contains a single file i of size 584 and no other directories. The directory a has total size 94853 because it contains files f (size 29116), g (size 2557), and h.lst (size 62596), plus file i indirectly (a contains e which contains i). Directory d has total size 24933642. As the outermost directory, / contains every file. Its total size is 48381165, the sum of the size of every file. To begin, find all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000, then calculate the sum of their total sizes. In the example above, these directories are a and e; the sum of their total sizes is 95437 (94853 + 584). (As in this example, this process can count files more than once!)\nFind all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000.

    "text": "Space needs to be cleared before the last supplies can be unloaded from the ships, and so several Elves have been assigned the job of cleaning up sections of the camp. Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.\nHowever, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, they’ve noticed that many of the assignments overlap. To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and make a big list of the section assignments for each pair (your puzzle input).\nFor example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:\n2-4,6-8 2-3,4-5 5-7,7-9 2-8,3-7 6-6,4-6 2-6,4-8\nFor the first few pairs, this list means:\nWithin the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections 2-4 (sections 2, 3, and 4), while the second Elf was assigned sections 6-8 (sections 6, 7, 8). The Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections. The Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got sections 5, 6, and 7, while the other also got 7, plus 8 and 9. This example list uses single-digit section IDs to make it easier to draw; your actual list might contain larger numbers. Visually, these pairs of section assignments look like this:\n.234….. 2-4 …..678. 6-8\n.23…… 2-3 …45…. 4-5\n….567.. 5-7 ……789 7-9\n.2345678. 2-8 ..34567.. 3-7\n…..6… 6-6 …456… 4-6\n.23456… 2-6 …45678. 4-8\nSome of the pairs have noticed that one of their assignments fully contains the other.

    "text": "Space needs to be cleared before the last supplies can be unloaded from the ships, and so several Elves have been assigned the job of cleaning up sections of the camp. Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.\nHowever, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, they’ve noticed that many of the assignments overlap. To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and make a big list of the section assignments for each pair (your puzzle input).\nFor example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:\n2-4,6-8 2-3,4-5 5-7,7-9 2-8,3-7 6-6,4-6 2-6,4-8\nFor the first few pairs, this list means:\nWithin the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections 2-4 (sections 2, 3, and 4), while the second Elf was assigned sections 6-8 (sections 6, 7, 8). The Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections. The Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got sections 5, 6, and 7, while the other also got 7, plus 8 and 9. This example list uses single-digit section IDs to make it easier to draw; your actual list might contain larger numbers. Visually, these pairs of section assignments look like this:\n.234….. 2-4 …..678. 6-8\n.23…… 2-3 …45…. 4-5\n….567.. 5-7 ……789 7-9\n.2345678. 2-8 ..34567.. 3-7\n…..6… 6-6 …456… 4-6\n.23456… 2-6 …45678. 4-8\nSome of the pairs have noticed that one of their assignments fully contains the other. For example, 2-8 fully contains 3-7, and 6-6 is fully contained by 4-6. In pairs where one assignment fully contains the other, one Elf in the pair would be exclusively cleaning sections their partner will already be cleaning, so these seem like the most in need of reconsideration.

Failure to update the safety manuals would be dire indeed, so you offer your services.\nSafety protocols clearly indicate that new pages for the safety manuals must be printed in a very specific order. The notation X|Y means that if both page number X and page number Y are to be produced as part of an update, page number X must be printed at some point before page number Y.\nThe Elf has for you both the page ordering rules and the pages to produce in each update (your puzzle input), but can’t figure out whether each update has the pages in the right order.\nFor example:\n47|53\n97|13\n97|61\n97|47\n75|29\n61|13\n75|53\n29|13\n97|29\n53|29\n61|53\n97|53\n61|29\n47|13\n75|47\n97|75\n47|61\n75|61\n47|29\n75|13\n53|13\n\n75,47,61,53,29\n97,61,53,29,13\n75,29,13\n75,97,47,61,53\n61,13,29\n97,13,75,29,47\nThe first section specifies the page ordering rules, one per line. The first rule, 47|53, means that if an update includes both page number 47 and page number 53, then page number 47 must be printed at some point before page number 53. (47 doesn’t necessarily need to be immediately before 53; other pages are allowed to be between them.)\nThe second section specifies the page numbers of each update. Because most safety manuals are different, the pages needed in the updates are different too. The first update, 75,47,61,53,29, means that the update consists of page numbers 75, 47, 61, 53, and 29.\nTo get the printers going as soon as possible, start by identifying which updates are already in the right order.\nIn the above example, the first update (75,47,61,53,29) is in the right order:\n75 is correctly first because there are rules that put each other page after it: 75|47, 75|61, 75|53, and 75|29.\n47 is correctly second because 75 must be before it (75|47) and every other page must be after it according to 47|61, 47|53, and 47|29.\n61 is correctly in the middle because 75 and 47 are before it (75|61 and 47|61) and 53 and 29 are after it (61|53 and 61|29).\n53 is correctly fourth because it is before page number 29 (53|29).\n29 is the only page left and so is correctly last.\nBecause the first update does not include some page numbers, the ordering rules involving those missing page numbers are ignored.\nThe second and third updates are also in the correct order according to the rules. Like the first update, they also do not include every page number, and so only some of the ordering rules apply - within each update, the ordering rules that involve missing page numbers are not used.\nThe fourth update, 75,97,47,61,53, is not in the correct order: it would print 75 before 97, which violates the rule 97|75.\nThe fifth update, 61,13,29, is also not in the correct order, since it breaks the rule 29|13.\nThe last update, 97,13,75,29,47, is not in the correct order due to breaking several rules.\nFor some reason, the Elves also need to know the middle page number of each update being printed. Because you are currently only printing the correctly-ordered updates, you will need to find the middle page number of each correctly-ordered update. In the above example, the correctly-ordered updates are:\n75,47,61,53,29 97,61,53,29,13 75,29,13\nThese have middle page numbers of 61, 53, and 29 respectively. Adding these page numbers together gives 143.\nOf course, you’ll need to be careful: the actual list of page ordering rules is bigger and more complicated than the above example.\nDetermine which updates are already in the correct order.

The notation X|Y means that if both page number X and page number Y are to be produced as part of an update, page number X must be printed at some point before page number Y.\nThe Elf has for you both the page ordering rules and the pages to produce in each update (your puzzle input), but can’t figure out whether each update has the pages in the right order.\nFor example:\n47|53\n97|13\n97|61\n97|47\n75|29\n61|13\n75|53\n29|13\n97|29\n53|29\n61|53\n97|53\n61|29\n47|13\n75|47\n97|75\n47|61\n75|61\n47|29\n75|13\n53|13\n\n75,47,61,53,29\n97,61,53,29,13\n75,29,13\n75,97,47,61,53\n61,13,29\n97,13,75,29,47\nThe first section specifies the page ordering rules, one per line. The first rule, 47|53, means that if an update includes both page number 47 and page number 53, then page number 47 must be printed at some point before page number 53. (47 doesn’t necessarily need to be immediately before 53; other pages are allowed to be between them.)\nThe second section specifies the page numbers of each update. Because most safety manuals are different, the pages needed in the updates are different too. The first update, 75,47,61,53,29, means that the update consists of page numbers 75, 47, 61, 53, and 29.\nTo get the printers going as soon as possible, start by identifying which updates are already in the right order.\nIn the above example, the first update (75,47,61,53,29) is in the right order:\n75 is correctly first because there are rules that put each other page after it: 75|47, 75|61, 75|53, and 75|29.\n47 is correctly second because 75 must be before it (75|47) and every other page must be after it according to 47|61, 47|53, and 47|29.\n61 is correctly in the middle because 75 and 47 are before it (75|61 and 47|61) and 53 and 29 are after it (61|53 and 61|29).\n53 is correctly fourth because it is before page number 29 (53|29).\n29 is the only page left and so is correctly last.\nBecause the first update does not include some page numbers, the ordering rules involving those missing page numbers are ignored.\nThe second and third updates are also in the correct order according to the rules. Like the first update, they also do not include every page number, and so only some of the ordering rules apply - within each update, the ordering rules that involve missing page numbers are not used.\nThe fourth update, 75,97,47,61,53, is not in the correct order: it would print 75 before 97, which violates the rule 97|75.\nThe fifth update, 61,13,29, is also not in the correct order, since it breaks the rule 29|13.\nThe last update, 97,13,75,29,47, is not in the correct order due to breaking several rules.\nFor some reason, the Elves also need to know the middle page number of each update being printed. Because you are currently only printing the correctly-ordered updates, you will need to find the middle page number of each correctly-ordered update. In the above example, the correctly-ordered updates are:\n75,47,61,53,29 97,61,53,29,13 75,29,13\nThese have middle page numbers of 61, 53, and 29 respectively. Adding these page numbers together gives 143.\nOf course, you’ll need to be careful: the actual list of page ordering rules is bigger and more complicated than the above example.\nDetermine which updates are already in the correct order. What do you get if you add up the middle page number from those correctly-ordered updates?\n\nlibrary(parallel)\n\ninp &lt;- readLines(\"input\")\n\ntab &lt;- inp[1:(which(inp == \"\")-1)] |&gt; \n  data.frame(both = _) |&gt; \n  tidyr::separate_wider_delim(both, \"|\", names = c(\"X\", \"Y\"))\n\n\nupdates &lt;- inp[(which(inp == \"\")+1):length(inp)] |&gt; \n  strsplit(\",\")\n\n\n# x = updates[[1]]\n\np1 &lt;- mclapply(updates, \\(x) {\n  \n  holder &lt;- vector(length = length(x))\n  \n  for(i in 1:length(x)) {\n    \n    tmp &lt;- tab |&gt; \n      dplyr::filter(X == x[i] | Y == x[i]) |&gt; \n      dplyr::filter(X %in% x & Y %in% x)\n    \n    if(any(tmp$Y %in% x[1:(i-1)])) {\n      holder[i] &lt;- \"invalid\"\n      break\n    }\n    \n    if(any(tmp$X %in% x[(i+1):length(x)])) {\n      holder[i] &lt;- \"invalid\"\n      break\n    }\n    \n    holder[i] &lt;- \"valid\"\n  }\n  \n  if(all(holder == \"valid\")) {\n    return(x[ceiling((length(x)) / 2)])\n  } else {\n    return(NA)\n  }\n  \n}, mc.cores = detectCores() - 1) |&gt; unlist() \n\np1 |&gt; as.numeric() |&gt; sum(na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 5208",

    "text": "The expedition can depart as soon as the final supplies have been unloaded from the ships. Supplies are stored in stacks of marked crates, but because the needed supplies are buried under many other crates, the crates need to be rearranged.\nThe ship has a giant cargo crane capable of moving crates between stacks. To ensure none of the crates get crushed or fall over, the crane operator will rearrange them in a series of carefully-planned steps. After the crates are rearranged, the desired crates will be at the top of each stack.\nThe Elves don’t want to interrupt the crane operator during this delicate procedure, but they forgot to ask her which crate will end up where, and they want to be ready to unload them as soon as possible so they can embark.\nThey do, however, have a drawing of the starting stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure (your puzzle input). For example:\n[D]    \n[N] [C]\n[Z] [M] [P] 1 2 3\nmove 1 from 2 to 1 move 3 from 1 to 3 move 2 from 2 to 1 move 1 from 1 to 2 In this example, there are three stacks of crates. Stack 1 contains two crates: crate Z is on the bottom, and crate N is on top. Stack 2 contains three crates; from bottom to top, they are crates M, C, and D. Finally, stack 3 contains a single crate, P.\nThen, the rearrangement procedure is given. In each step of the procedure, a quantity of crates is moved from one stack to a different stack. In the first step of the above rearrangement procedure, one crate is moved from stack 2 to stack 1, resulting in this configuration:\n[D]\n[N] [C]\n[Z] [M] [P] 1 2 3 In the second step, three crates are moved from stack 1 to stack 3. Crates are moved one at a time, so the first crate to be moved (D) ends up below the second and third crates:\n    [Z]\n    [N]\n[C] [D]\n[M] [P]\n1 2 3 Then, both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1.

    "text": "The expedition can depart as soon as the final supplies have been unloaded from the ships. Supplies are stored in stacks of marked crates, but because the needed supplies are buried under many other crates, the crates need to be rearranged.\nThe ship has a giant cargo crane capable of moving crates between stacks. To ensure none of the crates get crushed or fall over, the crane operator will rearrange them in a series of carefully-planned steps. After the crates are rearranged, the desired crates will be at the top of each stack.\nThe Elves don’t want to interrupt the crane operator during this delicate procedure, but they forgot to ask her which crate will end up where, and they want to be ready to unload them as soon as possible so they can embark.\nThey do, however, have a drawing of the starting stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure (your puzzle input).

Stack 1 contains two crates: crate Z is on the bottom, and crate N is on top. Stack 2 contains three crates; from bottom to top, they are crates M, C, and D. Finally, stack 3 contains a single crate, P.\nThen, the rearrangement procedure is given. In each step of the procedure, a quantity of crates is moved from one stack to a different stack. In the first step of the above rearrangement procedure, one crate is moved from stack 2 to stack 1, resulting in this configuration:\n[D]\n[N] [C]\n[Z] [M] [P] 1 2 3 In the second step, three crates are moved from stack 1 to stack 3.

    "text": "One Elf has the important job of loading all of the rucksacks with supplies for the jungle journey. Unfortunately, that Elf didn’t quite follow the packing instructions, and so a few items now need to be rearranged.\nEach rucksack has two large compartments. All items of a given type are meant to go into exactly one of the two compartments. The Elf that did the packing failed to follow this rule for exactly one item type per rucksack.\nThe Elves have made a list of all of the items currently in each rucksack (your puzzle input), but they need your help finding the errors. Every item type is identified by a single lowercase or uppercase letter (that is, a and A refer to different types of items).\nThe list of items for each rucksack is given as characters all on a single line. A given rucksack always has the same number of items in each of its two compartments, so the first half of the characters represent items in the first compartment, while the second half of the characters represent items in the second compartment.\nFor example, suppose you have the following list of contents from six rucksacks:\nvJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw\nThe first rucksack contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp, which means its first compartment contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWr, while the second compartment contains the items hcsFMMfFFhFp. The only item type that appears in both compartments is lowercase p. The second rucksack’s compartments contain jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGL and rsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL. The only item type that appears in both compartments is uppercase L. The third rucksack’s compartments contain PmmdzqPrV and vPwwTWBwg; the only common item type is uppercase P. The fourth rucksack’s compartments only share item type v. The fifth rucksack’s compartments only share item type t. The sixth rucksack’s compartments only share item type s. To help prioritize item rearrangement, every item type can be converted to a priority:\nLowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26. Uppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52. In the above example, the priority of the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack is 16 (p), 38 (L), 42 (P), 22 (v), 20 (t), and 19 (s); the sum of these is 157.\nFind the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack. What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ninput &lt;- readLines(\"day3.txt\")\n\nscores &lt;- data.frame(letters = c(letters, LETTERS),\n                     score = 1:52)\n\nitem_in_both &lt;- lapply(input, function(x){\n  \n  tmp &lt;- c(substr(x, 1, nchar(x)/2), substr(x, nchar(x)/2+1, nchar(x)))\n  tmp &lt;- strsplit(tmp, \"\")\n  \n  return(intersect(tmp[[1]], tmp[[2]]))\n  \n})\n\nitem_in_both %&gt;% \n  unlist() %&gt;% \n  tibble(item_in_both = .) %&gt;% \n  left_join(., scores, by = c(\"item_in_both\" = \"letters\")) %&gt;% \n  pull(score) %&gt;% \n  sum()\n\n[1] 8233\n\n\n\n\n\n— Part Two — As you finish identifying the misplaced items, the Elves come to you with another issue.\nFor safety, the Elves are divided into groups of three. Every Elf carries a badge that identifies their group. For efficiency, within each group of three Elves, the badge is the only item type carried by all three Elves. That is, if a group’s badge is item type B, then all three Elves will have item type B somewhere in their rucksack, and at most two of the Elves will be carrying any other item type.\nThe problem is that someone forgot to put this year’s updated authenticity sticker on the badges. All of the badges need to be pulled out of the rucksacks so the new authenticity stickers can be attached.\nAdditionally, nobody wrote down which item type corresponds to each group’s badges. The only way to tell which item type is the right one is by finding the one item type that is common between all three Elves in each group.\nEvery set of three lines in your list corresponds to a single group, but each group can have a different badge item type. So, in the above example, the first group’s rucksacks are the first three lines:\nvJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg\nAnd the second group’s rucksacks are the next three lines:\nwMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw\nIn the first group, the only item type that appears in all three rucksacks is lowercase r; this must be their badges.

    "text": "One Elf has the important job of loading all of the rucksacks with supplies for the jungle journey. Unfortunately, that Elf didn’t quite follow the packing instructions, and so a few items now need to be rearranged.\nEach rucksack has two large compartments. All items of a given type are meant to go into exactly one of the two compartments. The Elf that did the packing failed to follow this rule for exactly one item type per rucksack.\nThe Elves have made a list of all of the items currently in each rucksack (your puzzle input), but they need your help finding the errors. Every item type is identified by a single lowercase or uppercase letter (that is, a and A refer to different types of items).\nThe list of items for each rucksack is given as characters all on a single line. A given rucksack always has the same number of items in each of its two compartments, so the first half of the characters represent items in the first compartment, while the second half of the characters represent items in the second compartment.\nFor example, suppose you have the following list of contents from six rucksacks:\nvJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw\nThe first rucksack contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp, which means its first compartment contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWr, while the second compartment contains the items hcsFMMfFFhFp. The only item type that appears in both compartments is lowercase p. The second rucksack’s compartments contain jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGL and rsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL. The only item type that appears in both compartments is uppercase L. The third rucksack’s compartments contain PmmdzqPrV and vPwwTWBwg; the only common item type is uppercase P. The fourth rucksack’s compartments only share item type v. The fifth rucksack’s compartments only share item type t. The sixth rucksack’s compartments only share item type s. To help prioritize item rearrangement, every item type can be converted to a priority:\nLowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26. Uppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52. In the above example, the priority of the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack is 16 (p), 38 (L), 42 (P), 22 (v), 20 (t), and 19 (s); the sum of these is 157.\nFind the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack. What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ninput &lt;- readLines(\"day3.txt\")\n\nscores &lt;- data.frame(letters = c(letters, LETTERS),\n                     score = 1:52)\n\nitem_in_both &lt;- lapply(input, function(x){\n  \n  tmp &lt;- c(substr(x, 1, nchar(x)/2), substr(x, nchar(x)/2+1, nchar(x)))\n  tmp &lt;- strsplit(tmp, \"\")\n  \n  return(intersect(tmp[[1]], tmp[[2]]))\n  \n})\n\nitem_in_both %&gt;% \n  unlist() %&gt;% \n  tibble(item_in_both = .) %&gt;% \n  left_join(., scores, by = c(\"item_in_both\" = \"letters\")) %&gt;% \n  pull(score) %&gt;% \n  sum()\n\n[1] 8233",

    "text": "— Part Two — As you finish identifying the misplaced items, the Elves come to you with another issue.\nFor safety, the Elves are divided into groups of three. Every Elf carries a badge that identifies their group. For efficiency, within each group of three Elves, the badge is the only item type carried by all three Elves. That is, if a group’s badge is item type B, then all three Elves will have item type B somewhere in their rucksack, and at most two of the Elves will be carrying any other item type.\nThe problem is that someone forgot to put this year’s updated authenticity sticker on the badges. All of the badges need to be pulled out of the rucksacks so the new authenticity stickers can be attached.\nAdditionally, nobody wrote down which item type corresponds to each group’s badges. The only way to tell which item type is the right one is by finding the one item type that is common between all three Elves in each group.\nEvery set of three lines in your list corresponds to a single group, but each group can have a different badge item type. So, in the above example, the first group’s rucksacks are the first three lines:\nvJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg\nAnd the second group’s rucksacks are the next three lines:\nwMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw\nIn the first group, the only item type that appears in all three rucksacks is lowercase r; this must be their badges.

    "text": "Santa’s reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.\nTo supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.\nCollect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\nThe jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves’ expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).\nThe Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they’ve brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf’s inventory (if any) by a blank line.\nFor example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items’ Calories and end up with the following list:\n1000 2000 3000\n4000\n5000 6000\n7000 8000 9000\n10000 This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:\nThe first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories. The second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories. The third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories. The fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories. The fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories. In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they’d like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories.

    "text": "Santa’s reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.\nTo supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.\nCollect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\nThe jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves’ expedition traditionally goes on foot.

Instead, the Elves discover an assortment of notes and lists of historically significant locations! This seems to be the planning the Chief Historian was doing before he left.

    "text": "“Our computers are having issues, so I have no idea if we have any Chief Historians in stock! You’re welcome to check the warehouse, though,” says the mildly flustered shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop. The Historians head out to take a look.\nThe shopkeeper turns to you. “Any chance you can see why our computers are having issues again?”\nThe computer appears to be trying to run a program, but its memory (your puzzle input) is corrupted. All of the instructions have been jumbled up!\nIt seems like the goal of the program is just to multiply some numbers. It does that with instructions like mul(X,Y), where X and Y are each 1-3 digit numbers. For instance, mul(44,46) multiplies 44 by 46 to get a result of 2024. Similarly, mul(123,4) would multiply 123 by 4.\nHowever, because the program’s memory has been corrupted, there are also many invalid characters that should be ignored, even if they look like part of a mul instruction. Sequences like mul(4*, mul(6,9!, ?(12,34), or mul ( 2 , 4 ) do nothing.\nFor example, consider the following section of corrupted memory:\nxmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))\nOnly the four highlighted sections are real mul instructions. Adding up the result of each instruction produces 161 (2*4 + 5*5 + 11*8 + 8*5).\nScan the corrupted memory for uncorrupted mul instructions. What do you get if you add up all of the results of the multiplications?\n\ninp &lt;- readLines(\"input.txt\")\n\nvalid_mults &lt;- stringr::str_extract_all(inp, \"mul\\\\([0-9]{1,3}\\\\,[0-9]{1,3}\\\\)\")\n\nprods &lt;- list()\n\nfor(x in 1:length(valid_mults)) {\n  \n  tmp_prods &lt;- lapply(valid_mults[[x]], \\(y) {\n    \n    prod(as.numeric(unlist(stringr::str_extract_all(y, \"[0-9]+\"))))\n    \n  })\n  \n  prods[[x]] &lt;- unlist(tmp_prods)\n  \n}\n\n\nsum(unlist(prods))\n\n[1] 175700056\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you scan through the corrupted memory, you notice that some of the conditional statements are also still intact.

    "text": "“Our computers are having issues, so I have no idea if we have any Chief Historians in stock! You’re welcome to check the warehouse, though,” says the mildly flustered shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop. The Historians head out to take a look.\nThe shopkeeper turns to you. “Any chance you can see why our computers are having issues again?”\nThe computer appears to be trying to run a program, but its memory (your puzzle input) is corrupted. All of the instructions have been jumbled up!\nIt seems like the goal of the program is just to multiply some numbers. It does that with instructions like mul(X,Y), where X and Y are each 1-3 digit numbers. For instance, mul(44,46) multiplies 44 by 46 to get a result of 2024. Similarly, mul(123,4) would multiply 123 by 4.\nHowever, because the program’s memory has been corrupted, there are also many invalid characters that should be ignored, even if they look like part of a mul instruction. Sequences like mul(4*, mul(6,9!, ?(12,34), or mul ( 2 , 4 ) do nothing.\nFor example, consider the following section of corrupted memory:\nxmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))\nOnly the four highlighted sections are real mul instructions. Adding up the result of each instruction produces 161 (2*4 + 5*5 + 11*8 + 8*5).\nScan the corrupted memory for uncorrupted mul instructions.

    "text": "The Elves have good news and bad news.\nThe good news is that they’ve discovered project management! This has given them the tools they need to prevent their usual Christmas emergency. For example, they now know that the North Pole decorations need to be finished soon so that other critical tasks can start on time.\nThe bad news is that they’ve realized they have a different emergency: according to their resource planning, none of them have any time left to decorate the North Pole!\nTo save Christmas, the Elves need you to finish decorating the North Pole by December 12th.\nCollect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\n\n\nYou arrive at the secret entrance to the North Pole base ready to start decorating. Unfortunately, the password seems to have been changed, so you can’t get in. A document taped to the wall helpfully explains:\n“Due to new security protocols, the password is locked in the safe below. Please see the attached document for the new combination.”\nThe safe has a dial with only an arrow on it; around the dial are the numbers 0 through 99 in order. As you turn the dial, it makes a small click noise as it reaches each number.\nThe attached document (your puzzle input) contains a sequence of rotations, one per line, which tell you how to open the safe. A rotation starts with an L or R which indicates whether the rotation should be to the left (toward lower numbers) or to the right (toward higher numbers). Then, the rotation has a distance value which indicates how many clicks the dial should be rotated in that direction.\nSo, if the dial were pointing at 11, a rotation of R8 would cause the dial to point at 19. After that, a rotation of L19 would cause it to point at 0.\nBecause the dial is a circle, turning the dial left from 0 one click makes it point at 99. Similarly, turning the dial right from 99 one click makes it point at 0.\nSo, if the dial were pointing at 5, a rotation of L10 would cause it to point at 95. After that, a rotation of R5 could cause it to point at 0.\nThe dial starts by pointing at 50.\nYou could follow the instructions, but your recent required official North Pole secret entrance security training seminar taught you that the safe is actually a decoy. The actual password is the number of times the dial is left pointing at 0 after any rotation in the sequence.\nFor example, suppose the attached document contained the following rotations:\nL68 L30 R48 L5 R60 L55 L1 L99 R14 L82\nFollowing these rotations would cause the dial to move as follows:\nThe dial starts by pointing at 50. The dial is rotated L68 to point at 82. The dial is rotated L30 to point at 52. The dial is rotated R48 to point at 0. The dial is rotated L5 to point at 95. The dial is rotated R60 to point at 55. The dial is rotated L55 to point at 0. The dial is rotated L1 to point at 99. The dial is rotated L99 to point at 0. The dial is rotated R14 to point at 14. The dial is rotated L82 to point at 32.\nBecause the dial points at 0 a total of three times during this process, the password in this example is 3.\nAnalyze the rotations in your attached document.

So, in this example, the new password would be 6.\nBe careful: if the dial were pointing at 50, a single rotation like R1000 would cause the dial to point at 0 ten times before returning back to 50!\nUsing password method 0x434C49434B, what is the password to open the door?\n\nlookup &lt;- data.frame(x = 0:99, \n                     y = 1:1000)\n\nlookup &lt;- lookup |&gt; \n  dplyr::arrange(x) |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(num = 1, \n                num = cumsum(num), \n                .by = x)\n\nposition &lt;- 50\n\nclicks &lt;- 0\n\nfor(x in manual){\n  \n  segment &lt;- unlist(strsplit(x, \"(?=[RL])\", perl = TRUE))\n\n  if(segment[1] == \"R\") {\n    \n    if(position + as.numeric(segment[2]) == 100) {\n      \n      clicks &lt;- clicks + 1\n      \n      position &lt;- 0\n    }\n    \n    if(position + as.numeric(segment[2]) &gt; 99) {\n      \n      clicks &lt;- clicks + lookup$num[which(lookup$y == as.numeric(segment[2]) - (100 - position))]\n      \n      position &lt;- (position + as.numeric(segment[2])) %% 100\n    \n    } else {\n      \n      position &lt;- position + as.numeric(segment[2])\n      \n    }\n    \n  }\n  \n  if(segment[1] == \"L\") {\n    \n    \n    if((100 - position - as.numeric(segment[2])) == 0) {\n      \n      clicks &lt;- clicks + 1\n      \n      position &lt;- 0\n      \n    }\n    \n    if(position - as.numeric(segment[2]) &lt; 0) {\n      \n      clicks &lt;- clicks + lookup$num[which(lookup$y == abs(100 - position - as.numeric(segment[2])))]\n      \n      position &lt;- (position - as.numeric(segment[2])) %% 100\n      \n      \n    } else {\n      \n      position &lt;- position - as.numeric(segment[2])\n      \n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclicks\n\n[1] 6358",

    "section": "",
    "text": "You arrive at the secret entrance to the North Pole base ready to start decorating. Unfortunately, the password seems to have been changed, so you can’t get in. A document taped to the wall helpfully explains:\n“Due to new security protocols, the password is locked in the safe below. Please see the attached document for the new combination.”\nThe safe has a dial with only an arrow on it; around the dial are the numbers 0 through 99 in order. As you turn the dial, it makes a small click noise as it reaches each number.\nThe attached document (your puzzle input) contains a sequence of rotations, one per line, which tell you how to open the safe. A rotation starts with an L or R which indicates whether the rotation should be to the left (toward lower numbers) or to the right (toward higher numbers). Then, the rotation has a distance value which indicates how many clicks the dial should be rotated in that direction.\nSo, if the dial were pointing at 11, a rotation of R8 would cause the dial to point at 19. After that, a rotation of L19 would cause it to point at 0.\nBecause the dial is a circle, turning the dial left from 0 one click makes it point at 99. Similarly, turning the dial right from 99 one click makes it point at 0.\nSo, if the dial were pointing at 5, a rotation of L10 would cause it to point at 95. After that, a rotation of R5 could cause it to point at 0.\nThe dial starts by pointing at 50.\nYou could follow the instructions, but your recent required official North Pole secret entrance security training seminar taught you that the safe is actually a decoy. The actual password is the number of times the dial is left pointing at 0 after any rotation in the sequence.\nFor example, suppose the attached document contained the following rotations:\nL68 L30 R48 L5 R60 L55 L1 L99 R14 L82\nFollowing these rotations would cause the dial to move as follows:\nThe dial starts by pointing at 50. The dial is rotated L68 to point at 82. The dial is rotated L30 to point at 52. The dial is rotated R48 to point at 0. The dial is rotated L5 to point at 95. The dial is rotated R60 to point at 55. The dial is rotated L55 to point at 0. The dial is rotated L1 to point at 99. The dial is rotated L99 to point at 0. The dial is rotated R14 to point at 14. The dial is rotated L82 to point at 32.\nBecause the dial points at 0 a total of three times during this process, the password in this example is 3.\nAnalyze the rotations in your attached document.

    "text": "You’re sure that’s the right password, but the door won’t open. You knock, but nobody answers. You build a snowman while you think.\nAs you’re rolling the snowballs for your snowman, you find another security document that must have fallen into the snow:\n“Due to newer security protocols, please use password method 0x434C49434B until further notice.”\nYou remember from the training seminar that “method 0x434C49434B” means you’re actually supposed to count the number of times any click causes the dial to point at 0, regardless of whether it happens during a rotation or at the end of one.\nFollowing the same rotations as in the above example, the dial points at zero a few extra times during its rotations:\nThe dial starts by pointing at 50.\nThe dial is rotated L68 to point at 82; during this rotation, it points at 0 once.\nThe dial is rotated L30 to point at 52.\nThe dial is rotated R48 to point at 0.\nThe dial is rotated L5 to point at 95.\nThe dial is rotated R60 to point at 55; during this rotation, it points at 0 once.\nThe dial is rotated L55 to point at 0.\nThe dial is rotated L1 to point at 99.\nThe dial is rotated L99 to point at 0.\nThe dial is rotated R14 to point at 14.\nThe dial is rotated L82 to point at 32; during this rotation, it points at 0 once.\nIn this example, the dial points at 0 three times at the end of a rotation, plus three more times during a rotation. So, in this example, the new password would be 6.\nBe careful: if the dial were pointing at 50, a single rotation like R1000 would cause the dial to point at 0 ten times before returning back to 50!\nUsing password method 0x434C49434B, what is the password to open the door?\n\nlookup &lt;- data.frame(x = 0:99, \n                     y = 1:1000)\n\nlookup &lt;- lookup |&gt; \n  dplyr::arrange(x) |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(num = 1, \n                num = cumsum(num), \n                .by = x)\n\nposition &lt;- 50\n\nclicks &lt;- 0\n\nfor(x in manual){\n  \n  segment &lt;- unlist(strsplit(x, \"(?=[RL])\", perl = TRUE))\n\n  if(segment[1] == \"R\") {\n    \n    if(position + as.numeric(segment[2]) == 100) {\n      \n      clicks &lt;- clicks + 1\n      \n      position &lt;- 0\n    }\n    \n    if(position + as.numeric(segment[2]) &gt; 99) {\n      \n      clicks &lt;- clicks + lookup$num[which(lookup$y == as.numeric(segment[2]) - (100 - position))]\n      \n      position &lt;- (position + as.numeric(segment[2])) %% 100\n    \n    } else {\n      \n      position &lt;- position + as.numeric(segment[2])\n      \n    }\n    \n  }\n  \n  if(segment[1] == \"L\") {\n    \n    \n    if((100 - position - as.numeric(segment[2])) == 0) {\n      \n      clicks &lt;- clicks + 1\n      \n      position &lt;- 0\n      \n    }\n    \n    if(position - as.numeric(segment[2]) &lt; 0) {\n      \n      clicks &lt;- clicks + lookup$num[which(lookup$y == abs(100 - position - as.numeric(segment[2])))]\n      \n      position &lt;- (position - as.numeric(segment[2])) %% 100\n      \n      \n    } else {\n      \n      position &lt;- position - as.numeric(segment[2])\n      \n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclicks\n\n[1] 6358",
